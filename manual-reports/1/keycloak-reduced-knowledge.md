## Summary

There appears to be an authorization flaw in managed-resource policy creation. A regular authenticated user may be able to create or influence permission state for a resource they do not own by sending a policy-management request that crosses resource boundaries.

## Threat Model And Roles

Assume two normal users exist in the same deployment and each owns distinct protected resources. One user should not be able to manipulate authorization state for the other user's resource through standard product workflows.

## Protected Asset Or Action

The protected asset is another user's resource and the authorization decision attached to it. The protected action is any ability to grant, inherit, or obtain access that should remain scoped to the resource owner.

## Suspected Boundary Failure

The likely issue is not raw authentication bypass, but a broken access-control condition inside the authorization-management flow. The system may accept a request whose visible context belongs to one resource while some of the effective permission state ends up attached to a different resource.

## Minimal Context

- the issue should be testable through standard product functionality
- the attacker is not assumed to be an admin
- the behavior should be evaluated as a cross-user authorization problem

## Expected Vs Actual Behavior

Expected:

- authorization-management operations should remain bound to the caller's own resource scope
- references that escape that scope should be rejected

Actual:

- authorization state may cross from one user's resource boundary into another's
- the caller may receive access that violates normal ownership expectations

## Impact

If confirmed, this would allow one user to influence or obtain access to another user's protected resource through normal authorization features rather than through direct administrative control.
